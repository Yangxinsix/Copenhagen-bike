This is a project that detects helmet use of bike riders in Copenhagen area


All results can be found in implemention.ipynb notebook.

We use **darknet** for training YOLOv3 model that is implement elsewhere. The trained weights file is yolov3-new-rider.weights in the root directory.

The ResNet34 model is trained in another notebook named position_encoding.ipynb. The trained weights are stored in save_model directory.
